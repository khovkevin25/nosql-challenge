# nosql-challenge

## Kevin Khov

In this challenge, we utilized MongoDB to update a local database of establishments in the United Kingdom. Using MongoDB, we were able to perform updates to an existing database and subsequently perform exploratory data analysis.

The json file containing the data can be found under "establishments.json". This file can be found in the "Resources" folder. The code used to update the database with the given information can be found in "NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb". The code used to perform a data analysis can be found in "NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb".
